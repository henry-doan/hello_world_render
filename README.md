  - migration from heroku is most terms and other things of how it works
  - Free instance hours
    - Render grants 750 Free instance hours to each user and team per calendar month:
cons
  - database gets deleted after 30 days
    - then have to do paid tier
  - Single-instance limit
    - Only one Free PostgreSQL database can be active for any given Render user or team.
  - Only one Free Redis instance can be active for any given Render user or team.
  - Ephemeral storage
    - Free Redis instances are not backed by a persistent disk. Whenever an instance restarts, all of its data is lost.
